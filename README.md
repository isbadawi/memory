Little toy memory game in C with SDL.

Should just make out of the box (on Linux at least) if you have SDL and 
SDL_image installed.  Instructions on how to do this vary with your 
operating system. On Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-image1.2-dev

On OSX with homebrew, this should work:

    brew install sdl sdl_image
